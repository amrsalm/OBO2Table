Type IV is the first lesion considered advanced in this classification because of the severe intimal disorganization caused by the lipid core. The characteristic core appears to develop from an increase and the consequent confluence of the small isolated pools of extracellular lipid that characterize type III lesions. The increase in lipid is believed to result from continued insudation from the plasma. Type IV lesions, when they first appear in younger people, are found in the same locations as adaptive intimal thickenings of the eccentric type.

The most common presentation is with ascites, but can range from fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) to asymptomatic forms.

Hypophosphatemic rickets is the most common type of rickets that is characterized by low levels of serum phosphate, resistance to ultraviolet radiation or vitamin D intake. There are several issues involved in hypophosphatemic rickets such as calcium, vitamin D, phosphorus deficiencies. Moreover, other disorder can be associated with its occurrence such as absorption defects due to pancreatic, intestinal, gastric, and renal disorders and hepatobiliary disease. Symptoms are usually seen in childhood and can be varied in severity. Severe forms may be linked to bowing of the legs, poor bone growth, and short stature as well as joint and bone pain. Hypophosphatemic rickets are associated with renal excretion of phosphate, hypophosphatemia, and mineral defects in bones. The familial type of the disease is the most common type of rickets.""

HP:0025175	Honeycomb lung	"""Honeycombing represents destroyed and fibrotic lung tissue containing numerous cystic airspaces with thick fibrous walls, representing the late stage of various lung diseases, with complete loss of acinar architecture. The cysts range in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter, have variable wall thickness, and are lined by metaplastic bronchiolar epithelium. On chest radiographs, honeycombing appears as closely approximated ring shadows, typically 3-10 mm in diameter with walls 1-3 mm in thickness, that resemble a honeycomb; the finding implies end-stage lung disease. On CT scans, the appearance is of clustered cystic air spaces, typically of comparable diameters on the order of 3-10 mm but occasionally as large as 2.5 cm. Honeycombing is usually subpleural and is characterized by well-defined walls. It is a CT feature of established pulmonary fibrosis. Because honeycombing is often considered specific for pulmonary fibrosis and is an important criterion in the diagnosis of usual interstitial pneumonia, the term should be used with care, as it may directly impact patient care.""

HP:0030733	Vesicoallantoic abdominal wall defect	"""An abdominal wall defected related to a developmental anomaly of the allantois, which is an embryonic structure that develops as a diverticulum off the yolk sac at about 16 days post fertilization. During further development, the allantois becomes incorporated into the body of the embryo, connecting the ventral aspect of the urogenital sinus (which will develop into the upper pole of the urinary bladder) to the external portion of the umbilicus. Upon further development, the lumen of the allantois becomes obliterated and forms a thick fibrous cord called the urachus, which connects the apex of the bladder to the umbilicus. In adults, the urachus is known as the median umbilical ligament. Failure of the allantoic cavity to obliterate can result of one of four conditions: 1) congenital patent urachus (a completely open connection between bladder and umbilicus); 2) vesicourachal diverticulum (a diverticulum off the bladder but not communicating with the umbilicus); umbilical cyst and sinus (not communicating with the bladder); and 4) alternating urachal sinus. An abdominal wall defect can be associated with a urachal cyst."" [https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0003-6754, https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0736-9199, PMID:2521673]"

The alveolar cleft is between the lateral incisor and the canine. Absent septation between the nasal cavity and maxillary antrum, together with the distortion of the frontal process of the maxilla and lacrimal fossa, produces direct communication between the orbit, maxillary sinus, and nose. There is hypoplasia of the soft tissue margins of the cleft in the vertical dimension.

Marked dystopia of the right globe results in its inferior displacement into the medially deficient orbital floor and inferior rim. Both globes are otherwise normal. The complete palatal cleft passes through the maxilla medial to the infraorbital foramen and extends to the medial portion of the inferior orbital rim without evidence of an intact maxillary sinus. Bony septation persists medially, thereby separating the nasal cavity from the orbit, maxillary sinus, and mouth, which are contiguous. Marked midfacial hypoplasia is present.

This latter cleft enters the inferolateral orbital rim and floor without posterior communication with the inferior orbital fissure on the left side. Medial collapse of the lateral maxillary segments is present bilaterally, with reduction in the transverse dimensions of the maxillary arch. Manifestations of the skeletal disturbance in the sphenoid include a shortening and thickening of the lateral orbital walls in the region of the greater wing and mild asymmetric placement of the pterygoid plates relative to the midline.

Soft tissue clefting presents as a dermatocele, a true lateral eyelid coloboma with absence of the outer canthus, and anomalies of the globe itself, especially epibulbar cysts in patients with Goldenhar syndrome. The frontozygomatic bony cleft produces absence of the lateral orbital rim; this border now is formed by the hypoplastic greater wing of the sphenoid. The absence of bony support for the outer canthus produces lateral canthal dystopia and the characteristic antimongoloid slant of the palpebral fissures. Secondary to the bony deficiency in the lateral orbital wall and floor, there is soft tissue continuity between the orbit, temporal fossa, and infratemporal region. Preauricular hairline indicators delineate the Number 8 cleft as the first of the northbound clefts. Complete absence of the bony lateral orbital wall and rim constitute the skeletal element of the Number 8 cleft.

Accordingly, two distinct subtypes of VIN are recognised: the HPV-associated high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion/usual VIN (HSIL/uVIN) and the non-HPV-associated differentiated VIN (dVIN). HSIL is clinically identified by its multifocal, warty appearance and on histology by conspicuous cytological and architectural atypia. Differentiated VIN, on the other hand, often produces ill-defined lesions, and on histology, notoriously mimics non-neoplastic epithelial disorders (NNED), particularly LS.

When a multilingual speaker has aphasia following a stroke, the languages spoken premorbidly may show comparable or differential patterns of impairment. Differential patterns may manifest as greater impairment in one language compared to another, or as differences in the characteristics of aphasia. Clinical reports of bilingual aphasia show dissociations in the processing of the language learned first (L1) and and second (L2), with one language more impaired than the other. Other cases show a pattern of differential recovery where L2 is recovered only after L1. Another pattern is alternating antagonism; i.e., patients access one language in spontaneous speech and inhibit the other language for alternating periods. This term should be used for a type of aphasia in a person who speaks multiple languages in which the impairment is different for different languages."" [PMID:31024369]"
